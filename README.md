# Neural_Networks_Project 
The name of the project is the following: Augmenting Convolutional Networks with Attention-based Aggregation for Breast Cancer Detection.
This is the final project for the course of Neural Networks 2021/2022 held by professors Aurelio Uncini and Danilo Comminiello, at Sapienza University of Rome.

## 📝 Assignment
1.	Reimplement the network architecture in the [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13692) for Image Classification on CIFAR10.
2.  Apply this innovative architecture to Breast Cancer Detection.

## 💾 Dataset
-   [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
-   Kaggle Dataset for Breast Histopathology Images [Link 🔗](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)

## 📜 Results
For CIFAR10 dataset results are very good: <br><br>

For the Kaggle dataset we obtained 87.95% of accuracy: <br><br>

This work can be found in the [PDF report](./Neural_network_project_BETELLO_CARMIGNANI.pdf) and in the [PPT] presentation(./PPT_NN.pptx).>br><br>

We noticed that in this last image we couldn't know if the attention map created was highlighting the correct patch of the image or not, so we decided to use another [dataset](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CBIS-DDSM) where the ground trouth were provided:

This last step is currently under developing by professor Comminiello and one of his PhD students. [Here](./NN_last_report.pdf) you can find an abstract.
